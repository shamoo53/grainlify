# GitHub App Callback Not Working - Root Cause Analysis

## Current Status

✅ **Configuration is Correct:**
- Callback URL in GitHub App: `https://e1q8rizlta.loclx.io/auth/github/app/install/callback`
- Backend route registered: `GET /auth/github/app/install/callback`
- Tunnel is working (endpoint is reachable)
- `.env` has correct `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://e1q8rizlta.loclx.io`

❌ **Issue:**
- GitHub is not calling the callback after installation
- No logs appear when user completes installation on GitHub

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Issue #1: GitHub App Installation Flow

GitHub App installations work differently than OAuth:

1. **OAuth Flow:** User authorizes → GitHub redirects to callback URL
2. **App Installation Flow:** User installs app → GitHub may NOT redirect if:
   - The app is already installed
   - The installation is cancelled
   - The "Setup URL" is set (and takes precedence)

### Possible Issue #2: Setup URL vs Callback URL

Looking at your GitHub App settings:
- **Callback URL:** `https://e1q8rizlta.loclx.io/auth/github/app/install/callback` ✅
- **Setup URL:** Empty ✅

However, if "Setup URL" is set, GitHub might redirect there instead of the callback URL.

### Possible Issue #3: Installation Already Exists

If the GitHub App is already installed on the organization, GitHub might:
- Skip the installation flow
- Not redirect to callback
- Show "Already installed" message

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Installation Flow

1. **Uninstall the app first** (if already installed):
   - Go to: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/installations`
   - Find "Grainlify" app
   - Click "Uninstall"

2. **Try installation again:**
   - Go to your frontend
   - Click "Install GitHub App"
   - Complete the installation on GitHub
   - Watch backend logs

### Step 2: Check GitHub App Settings

In GitHub App settings → **"Post Installation"** section:

**"Setup URL (optional)":**
- ⬜ **MUST BE EMPTY** (or set to same as callback URL)
- If set to a different URL, GitHub will redirect there instead

**"Redirect on update":**
- ✅ **Should be checked**

### Step 3: Verify Callback URL is Saved

1. Go to: `https://github.com/settings/apps/grainlify`
2. Scroll to **"Identifying and authorizing users"**
3. Verify **"Callback URL"** is exactly:
   ```
   https://e1q8rizlta.loclx.io/auth/github/app/install/callback
   ```
4. Click **"Update GitHub App"** at the bottom (even if nothing changed)
5. GitHub will verify the URL is reachable

### Step 4: Test with Manual Installation

Try installing the app directly from GitHub:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/apps/grainlify/installations/new`
2. Select your organization
3. Select repositories
4. Click "Install"
5. Watch backend logs for callback

### Step 5: Check Backend Logs

After installation, you should see:

```
=== GitHub App callback endpoint hit ===
  method=GET
  path=/auth/github/app/install/callback
  full_url=/auth/github/app/install/callback?installation_id=...&state=...
```

**If you don't see this log:**
- GitHub is not calling the callback
- Check if tunnel is still running
- Check if callback URL in GitHub matches tunnel URL

## Debugging Commands

### Test if Callback Endpoint is Reachable

```bash
# Test through tunnel
curl -v "https://e1q8rizlta.loclx.io/auth/github/app/install/callback?installation_id=test&state=test"

# Should return: {"error":"invalid_or_expired_state"} (expected)
```

### Check Tunnel Status

```bash
# List active tunnels
loclx tunnel list

# If not running, start it:
loclx tunnel http --to localhost:8080
```

**Important:** If tunnel URL changes, update it in:
1. GitHub App settings (Callback URL)
2. Backend `.env` file (`PUBLIC_BASE_URL`)

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: "Setup URL" is Set

**Symptom:** GitHub redirects to Setup URL instead of Callback URL

**Fix:** 
- Go to GitHub App settings → "Post Installation"
- Clear "Setup URL" field (leave empty)
- Click "Update GitHub App"

### Issue 2: App Already Installed

**Symptom:** No redirect, installation page shows "Already installed"

**Fix:**
- Uninstall the app from organization settings
- Try installation again

### Issue 3: Tunnel URL Changed

**Symptom:** Callback URL in GitHub doesn't match current tunnel URL

**Fix:**
1. Check current tunnel URL: `loclx tunnel list`
2. Update GitHub App settings with new URL
3. Update `.env` file: `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://NEW_TUNNEL_URL`

### Issue 4: Installation Cancelled

**Symptom:** User clicks "Cancel" on GitHub installation page

**Fix:** Complete the installation (don't cancel)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Tunnel is running: `loclx tunnel list`
- [ ] Tunnel URL matches GitHub App callback URL
- [ ] Backend is running on `localhost:8080`
- [ ] Callback endpoint is reachable (curl test works)
- [ ] "Setup URL" in GitHub App is empty
- [ ] App is not already installed (uninstall if needed)
- [ ] Try installation again and watch backend logs
- [ ] Check for "=== GitHub App callback endpoint hit ===" log

## Next Steps

1. **Uninstall the app** (if already installed)
2. **Verify "Setup URL" is empty** in GitHub App settings
3. **Update GitHub App** (click "Update GitHub App" button)
4. **Try installation again** from frontend
5. **Watch backend logs** for callback

---

**Most Likely Issue:** The app is already installed, or "Setup URL" is interfering with the callback. Uninstall the app and try again.
